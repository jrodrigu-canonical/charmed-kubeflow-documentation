Get started
===========

This guide describes how you can get started with Charmed Kubeflow (CKF), from deploying to accessing it. 
It is intended for system administrators and end users.

CKF provides a simple, out-of-the-box way to deploy Kubeflow. 
It sets default configurations, while still providing flexibility to configure it as you like.

.. note::
    This tutorial deploys the latest supported version of CKF. 
    For using other versions, check :ref:`Supported versions <supported_kubeflow_versions>` for compatibility with Kubernetes and Juju.

Requirements
------------

* Ubuntu 22.04 or later.
* A host machine with at least a 4-core CPU processor, 32GB RAM and 50GB of disk space available.

Install and configure dependencies
----------------------------------

CKF relies on:

* `Kubernetes`_ (K8s). This tutorial uses Canonical K8s, an enterprise-ready Kubernetes distribution.
* A software orchestration engine. This tutorial uses `Juju`_ to deploy and manage the Kubeflow components.
* Infrastructure as Code. This tutorial uses `Terraform`_ to provision the CKF deployment.
 
Install required tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the necessary packages and tools for the deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -yqq pipx git
    pipx ensurepath
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

Install Python package managers that will be used for managing dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipx install tox
    pipx install poetry

Install Terraform, Concierge, and Juju using snap:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo snap install terraform --channel latest/stable --classic
    sudo snap install concierge --classic
    sudo snap install juju --channel 3.6/stable --classic

.. note::
    This tutorial uses Juju 3.6. 
    For using other versions, check :ref:`Supported versions <supported_kubeflow_versions>` for compatibility with K8s.

Configure the environment with Concierge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Concierge automates the setup of Kubernetes and Juju for local development. 
Create a configuration file named ``concierge.yaml`` with the following content:

.. code-block:: yaml

    juju:
      channel: 3.6/stable
      agent-version: 3.6.28
      model-defaults:
        logging-config: <root>=INFO; unit=DEBUG

    providers:
      k8s:
        enable: true
        bootstrap: true
        channel: 1.32-classic/stable
        features:
          local-storage:
          load-balancer:
            enabled: true
            l2-mode: true
            cidrs: 10.64.140.43/32
        bootstrap-constraints:
          root-disk: 4G

      lxd:
        enable: true
        bootstrap: false
        channel: latest/stable

    host:
      snaps:
        charmcraft:
          channel: 3.x/stable

This configuration sets up:

* Juju 3.6 with specific agent version
* Canonical K8s 1.32 with local storage and load balancer features
* LXD for containerization support
* Charmcraft for charm development

.. warning::
    The ``cidrs`` value (``10.64.140.43/32``) specifies the IP address that will be assigned to the load balancer. 
    You may need to adjust this value based on your network configuration, by changing the ``cidrs`` value under
    the ``load-balancer`` configuration for `k8s`.

Run Concierge to prepare the environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo concierge prepare --trace

.. note::
    The preparation may take several minutes to complete as it installs and configures Canonical K8s and bootstraps the Juju controller.

Verify the Juju controller is running:

.. code-block:: bash

    juju status

Deploy CKF with Terraform
--------------------------

Clone the Charmed Kubeflow solutions repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/canonical/charmed-kubeflow-solutions.git
    cd charmed-kubeflow-solutions/

Switch to the 1.11 track:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout track/1.11

Navigate to the Kubeflow Terraform module:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd modules/kubeflow

Initialize Terraform to download the required providers and modules:

.. code-block:: bash

    terraform init

Deploy CKF using Terraform:

.. code-block:: bash

    terraform apply -auto-approve

.. note::
    The deployment may take 15-30 minutes to complete. 
    Terraform will provision all the necessary Kubeflow components and configure them automatically.

Monitor the deployment status:

.. code-block:: bash

    juju status

CKF is ready when all the applications and units are in ``active`` status.  
During the configuration process, some of the components may momentarily change to a ``blocked`` or ``error`` state. 
This is an expected behaviour that should resolve as the bundle configures itself. 

You can also check the Kubernetes services in the kubeflow namespace:

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl get svc -n kubeflow

Access your deployment
----------------------

You can interact with CKF using a dashboard, accessed through an IP address.

Configure dashboard access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable authentication for the dashboard, set a username and password as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    juju config dex-auth static-username=admin
    juju config dex-auth static-password=admin

Access the dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the IP address associated with your deployment, run the following command: 

.. code-block:: bash

    kubectl get svc -n kubeflow istio-ingressgateway-workload -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'

.. note::
    You should see an output like this: ``10.64.140.43``, which is the IP address configured in the Concierge setup. 
    If the output shows a different IP, use that IP for the rest of this tutorial.

To access your deployment, open a browser and visit the dashboard IP. 
You should see the login page where you need to enter the credentials previously set up.

.. note::
    Enter the username in the "Email Address" field.

You should now see the welcome page:

Get started by clicking on ``Start Setup``. 
Next, create a namespace for keeping all files and settings within a single location:

Click on ``Finish`` to display the dashboard:
